WORKING WITH JSON-SERVER
yarn add json-server
add the following key-value pairs in the package.json unser scripts section:
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "json-server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 3001",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },

Run the following command inside react project
npm run json-server

Make sure it runs on different port.
the url resource exists in http://localhost:3001/users/ but not in http://localhost:3001

WORKING WITH CONCURRENTLY PACKAGE
yarn add concurrently
We are using this package since we want npm start and npm run json-server to work at the same time.So It
can be used for crud operations later.
First concurrently will run then it will execute the precceding commands at same time
"start:dev":"concurrently \"npm start\" \"npm run json-server\"",
